##EPICS and User Stories

Three different EPICS were drafted. The EPIC are then broken down into user stories. 

The EPICS are:
-	Django setup and administrator/superuser
-	EPIC for unregistered users
-	EPIC for registered users

Some of the user stories that pertain to a certain EPIC may overlap with another EPIC. The reason is that some functionality available for superuser/admin likewise overlaps with the features planned for registered users.
GitHub projects was used to create the Kanban board to track the development of the user stories created for this project. The user stories are listed in teh Kanban board created.
