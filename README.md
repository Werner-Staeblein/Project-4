# Project Planning
	
This is project milestone 4 for the Code Institute full-stack development program. The project is a full-stack website built using the Django framework.

The live site deployed on Heroku can be found here: <link to Heroku>
[NAME OF THE BLOG] is .....where users can look for. For logged-in users, a like/unlike functionality for a post is possible. Logged-in users likewise can comment on a post.

## EPICS and User Stories

Three different EPICS were drafted. The EPICs are then broken down into user stories. 

The EPICS are:
-	Django setup and administrator/superuser
-	EPIC for unregistered users
-	EPIC for registered users

Some of the user stories that pertain to a certain EPIC may overlap with another EPIC. The reason is that some functionality available for superuser/admin likewise overlaps with the features planned for registered users.
GitHub projects was used to create the Kanban board to track the development of the user stories created for this project. The user stories are listed in the Kanban board created.

The Kanban board can be found here:

# Features




# Technologies

This is a full-stack (front-end/back-end) project with the primary use of HTML, CSS, and Python. The backend uses the Python framework Django.

The frontend primarily relies on the CSS framework Bootstrap for the efficient layout of mobile-first responsive design (MFRD).
